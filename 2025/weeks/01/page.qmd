title: "🗓️ Week 01 -Late 19th-century finance: First financial globalizations"
---

Financial globalization is not new. The first financial globalization reached its peak in the late 19^th^ / early 20^th^ century. It was a both a driver and a byproduct of colonial expansion and imperialism. We will discuss two competing interpretations of the relationship between the financial core and periphery during this period. From a ‘financing perspective’, wealth owners in the metropolis provided scarce financial capital to their colonies. From a ‘financial claim’ perspective, they acquired claims on local economies at prices kept artificially low—and returns kept artificially high—by power asymmetries. These competing perspectives and the resulting differing interpretations of core-periphery dynamics retain their relevance today.
