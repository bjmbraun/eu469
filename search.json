    "text": "What is global finance, really?\n\nBased on ‘poor’ countries’ negative current account balance—see Figure 1—during the 1870-1914 period, economists speak of “a significant resource transfer from rich to poor” (Schularick 2016).\nHowever, this interpretation ignores financial transfers from poor to rich (in balance of payments terminology: ‘primary income’; more in week 3)\n\n\n“a fact that may not be sufficiently well known, although it is well attested by trade statistics from the era and was well known to contemporaries. In the period 1880–1914, the United Kingdom and France earned so much from their investments in the rest of the world (roughly 5 percent additional national income for France and more than 8 percent for the United Kingdom) that they could allow themselves to run persistent structural trade deficits (an average of 1–2 percent of national income for both countries) while continuing to accumulate claims on the rest of the world at an accelerated pace.” (Piketty 2020, 283)"

    "text": "📑 Course Brief\nPolitics and policymaking in Europe happen in the context of a global monetary and financial order. This course teaches students a political economy framework to understand and analyse this order, and the privileges and constraints it imposes on financial, non-financial, and state actors in Europe. The introductory segment of the course examines the broad contours of the historical evolution of finance since the late 19th century: The first financial globalization in the shadow of European colonial expansion; the period of financial deglobalization following World War II; and the liberalization period that began in the 1970s. The second part focuses on the key actors (such as institutional capital pools) and the key assets (such as sovereign bonds) in Europe’s contemporary financial system. In order to be able to map the relationships between financial and non-financial actors, students learn how to access, process, and visualize financial data. The third part of the course brings this understanding of finance to bear on political challenges in Europe. What role does finance play in old-age provision? Can governments secure policy space in a world of global capital mobility? By the end of the course, students will have acquired the tools to analyse a broad range of political economy questions through a financial lens.\n\n\n🎯 Learning Objectives\nYou will learn to\n\nunderstand the global monetary and financial system as a set of interlocking, hierarchically organized balance sheets;\nuse R to obtain, process, and visualize financial data;\nidentify the distributional consequences of the existing order;\nunderstand why policy space is reduced for many countries, and what governments can do to increase it;\nhow to think about alternative institutional arrangements.\n\n\nSelect Academic Year/Term:\n 2024/25"

    "text": "Financial globalization is not new. The first financial globalization reached its peak in the late 19th / early 20th century. It was a both a driver and a byproduct of colonial expansion and imperialism. We will discuss two competing interpretations of the relationship between the financial core and periphery during this period. From a ‘financing perspective’, wealth owners in the metropolis provided scarce financial capital to their colonies. From a ‘financial claim’ perspective, they acquired claims on local economies at prices kept artificially low—and returns kept artificially high—by power asymmetries. These competing perspectives and the resulting differing interpretations of core-periphery dynamics retain their relevance today.",
